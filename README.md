# Kaggle Competitions Notebooks

Welcome to my repository for Kaggle competitions! This repository is organized to store all the notebooks and related files for various Kaggle challenges I've participated in.

## Repository Structure

- **/Binary Prediction of Poisonous Mushrooms**: The goal of this competition is to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical characteristics.

Each competition folder includes:

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks detailing my approach, code, and analysis.
- **Datasets**: Datasets used for the competition (if applicable and permitted).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kaggle-competitions-notebooks.git
